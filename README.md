# Verbal Coding

Verbal Coding is a combined verbal programming language (based off of ANTLR) and an AI-powered assistive IDE. It empowers visually impaired people to engage in coding for recreational, educational, and profressional uses.

The app includes a proprietary pipeline that converts between verbal programming language and a mainstream language (currently Python, Java, JavaScript are supported). This way, visually impaired users are integrated with existing software engineering teams.

Verbal Coding is on a mission to democratize programming for marginalized communities. With the power of AI, assistive design, and UI/UX design principles, we believe we will make this happen.

## Features
- **Code Recall** - frequently accessed variables and functions are recommended to the user, and they are analyzed for their contents and reported to the user.
- **Function componentization** - the nesting of large functions is described to the user, and they get metrics on how large and fragmented their code is.
- **Intelligent errors** - powered by an AI engine, Verbal Coding provides customized feeback for common errors done by visually impaired users.
- **Sentiment analysis** - recognizes tone and inflection in the user's voice, in order to understand emphasis and frustration when using different code structures.
